## Introduction

Many people use Vaultwarden as a self-hosted password manager.
The most common way to setup Vaultwarden is to use a reverse proxy like nginx, traefik or caddy. However there is another way to setup Vaultwarden without a reverse proxy.
This guide will show you how to set up Vaultwarden with a custom SSL certificate in a podman container.

## Prerequisites

- A Linux server or container with podman installed
- A valid SSL certificate (see <u>[Creating a Cloudflare SSL Certificate using certbot](/posts/creating-cloudflare-certificate)</u>)

## Installation

For this guide I assume that the current user is `root`. If you are not `root` you can prefix the commands with `sudo` or `doas`. Alternatively you can switch to the `root` user with `sudo su -`.

First lets create a directory for Vaultwarden.

I will create the `/vaultwarden` directory in my root directory. However you can choose any directory you want. One common place is `/opt/vaultwarden`.

```bash
cd /
mkdir /vaultwarden
cd /vaultwarden
```

now that we are in the `/vaultwarden` directory we have two options to install Vaultwarden.

1. Use a podman run command
2. Use a podman compose file

### Option 1: Use a podman run command

```bash
podman create \
    --name=vaultwarden \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    --label io.podman.compose.config-hash=123 \
    --label io.podman.compose.project=vaultwarden \
    --label io.podman.compose.version=0.0.1 \
    --label com.docker.compose.project=vaultwarden \
    --label com.docker.compose.project.working_dir=/vaultwarden \
    --label com.docker.compose.project.config_files=docker-compose.yml \
    --label com.docker.compose.container-number=1 \
    --label com.docker.compose.service=vaultwarden \
    -e DOMAIN=https://vault.itchronicles.org \
    -v /vaultwarden/vw-data:/data \
    -v /etc/letsencrypt/archive/vault.itchronicles.org/fullchain1.pem:/ssl/fullchain.pem:ro \
    -v /etc/letsencrypt/archive/vault.itchronicles.org/privkey1.pem:/ssl/privkey.pem:ro \
    --net vaultwarden_default \
    --network-alias vaultwarden \
    -p 443:80 \
    vaultwarden/server:latest \
    --disable-https \
    --ssl-cert /ssl/fullchain.pem \
    --ssl-key /ssl/privkey.pem
```

lets break down the command:

- `podman create` creates a new container
- `--name=vaultwarden` sets the name of the container to `vaultwarden`
- `--restart unless-stopped` sets the restart policy to `unless-stopped`
- `-e DOMAIN=https://vault.itchronicles.org` sets the domain to `https://vault.itchronicles.org`
- `-v /vaultwarden/vw-data:/data` mounts the `/vaultwarden/vw-data` directory to the container as `/data`
- `-v /etc/letsencrypt/archive/vault.itchronicles.org/fullchain1.pem:/ssl/fullchain.pem:ro` mounts the fullchain.pem file to the container as `/ssl/fullchain.pem`
- `-v /etc/letsencrypt/archive/vault.itchronicles.org/privkey1.pem:/ssl/privkey.pem:ro` mounts the privkey.pem file to the container as `/ssl/privkey.pem`
- `-p 443:80` Maps Port 443 on the host to Port 80 on the container
- `vaultwarden/server:latest` specifies the image to use
- `--disable-https` disables HTTPS
- `--ssl-cert /ssl/fullchain.pem` sets the SSL certificate to the fullchain.pem file
- `--ssl-key /ssl/privkey.pem` sets the SSL key to the privkey.pem file

### Option 2: Use a podman compose file

First we need to create a `podman-compose.yml` file.

```bash
touch podman-compose.yml
```

Now we can add the following content to the `podman-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
---
version: '4'

services:
  vaultwarden:
    image: vaultwarden/server:latest
    container_name: vaultwarden
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      DOMAIN: "https://vault.itchronicles.org"
      WEBSOCKET_ENABLED: "true"
      ROCKET_TLS: >
        {certs="/ssl/fullchain.pem",key="/ssl/privkey.pem"}        
    volumes:
      - /vaultwarden/vw-data:/data
      - /etc/letsencrypt/live/vault.itchronicles.org/fullchain.pem:/ssl/fullchain.pem:ro
      - /etc/letsencrypt/live/vault.itchronicles.org/privkey.pem:/ssl/privkey.pem:ro
    ports:
      - "443:80" 
```
after creating the docker compose file, you can start the container with the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
